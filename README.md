> SekaiBlender is a source-level Blender branch for MMD creators. It is a standalone application, not an add-on, and it does not replace an existing Blender installation.

## Download

A prebuilt Windows x64 package is published on the [Releases](https://github.com/kxgx/SekaiSource_Goo/releases/latest) page, so building from source is optional.

1. Download `sekaiblender-1.0-git.<hash>-windows64.zip` (about 329 MB) from the latest release.
2. Extract it anywhere. No installer and no administrator rights are required.
3. Run `SekaiBlender-launcher.exe` from the extracted folder. Use `SekaiBlender.exe` directly if you want the console window attached.

Keep the extracted folder intact: the executables load the `5.3` runtime directory that sits next to them.

## At A Glance

| Workflow | Included |
| --- | --- |
| **PMX** | Native import and export, materials, UVs, morphs, bones, rigid bodies and joints |
| **VMD** | Bone, morph and camera animation with Bezier interpolation |
| **IK** | Native CCD V8 solver with PMX schema 1/2 support and angle limits |
| **Physics** | Realtime Bullet preview, multi-model scenes and deterministic Action Bake |
| **Viewport** | MMD toon outlines, EEVEE workflows and AMD FSR 1.0 upscaling |

## Feature Set

### PMX Asset Pipeline

- PMX 2.0 import for BDEF/SDEF skinning, IK, append transforms, axis limits, materials, UVs, morphs and display frames.
- PMX export for imported models, including source retention, vertex morph offsets, physics definitions and packaged textures.
- Round-trip validation against real PMX models with field-by-field comparison across all 11 major sections.

### Animation And Camera

- VMD bone and morph Actions with position, quaternion and Bezier interpolation.
- Native VMD camera import and export with perspective/orthographic support.
- Camera rig export preserves per-channel Bezier curves when the source uses the supported rig layout.

### Realtime Physics

- Frame-authoritative realtime preview with independent Bullet worlds per model.
- Multiple MMD models in the same Scene.
- F8 Action Bake with progress, cancellation recovery, NLA validation and provenance metadata.

### Rendering And Look Development

- MMD edge preview driven by PMX `edge_flag` and `edge_size`.
- AMD FSR 1.0 EASU/RCAS quality presets for the EEVEE viewport and renders.
- **GPU render button** in the Render menu (`GPU 渲染（图像/动画）`): picks the best GPU backend automatically — NVIDIA renders through Cycles CUDA (prebuilt kernels for sm_86/sm_89), AMD through HIP when available, and falls back to the GPU GooEngine/EEVEE. The previous engine is restored after the render.
- **NVIDIA auto-acceleration**: on NVIDIA systems, Cycles CUDA devices are enabled automatically at startup (and via `GPU 加速设置…`), while Vulkan stays active for the viewport and the GPU CCD bake — CUDA and Vulkan work side by side.
- **Auto GPU bake on VMD import**: importing a VMD onto a PMX-rigged model automatically runs the GPU CCD bake (`use_gpu`, Vulkan compute) over the motion's frame range and assigns the resulting FK Action. Toggle with the `Auto GPU Bake` import option.
- GPU bake caches the compiled compute shader and the bone/chain/link constant buffers across calls, so repeat bakes skip the ~1–2 s shader compilation and constant uploads.
- SekaiBlender branding, Chinese UI defaults and a 30 FPS startup timeline.

## Verified Workflows

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| PMX / VMD / Blender kernel tests | 3/3 CTest suites passing |
| PMX, MMD and VMD direct tests | 170 passed, 11 environment-gated skips, 0 failed |
| PMX export round-trip | 2 real PMX models, all 11 sections matched |
| VMD camera round-trip | Real 27-frame sample, zero resampling error |

## Build On Windows

### Requirements

- Visual Studio 2022 with MSVC v143 or newer
- CMake 3.21 or newer
- Python 3.11 for the embedded runtime
- Git LFS and Git submodules
- CUDA Toolkit and OptiX SDK are optional GPU acceleration dependencies

### Clone

```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kxgx/SekaiSource_Goo.git
cd SekaiSource_Goo
git lfs install
git lfs pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The repository uses Git LFS for Blender test assets and other binary resources. The initial LFS download is large.

### Configure, Build And Run

```powershell
cmake -S . -B ..\build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 `
  -DWITH_CYCLES_CUDA_BINARIES=ON `
  -DWITH_CYCLES_DEVICE_OPTIX=ON

cmake --build ..\build --config Release --target INSTALL
..\build\bin\Release\SekaiBlender.exe
```

For a CPU-only build, omit the CUDA and OptiX options. The `INSTALL` target is intentional: it refreshes the runtime `5.3/scripts` tree used by the packaged executable.

## Known Limits

- The MMD → Rigify integration (`mmd_native_ik_override`, Rigify scene VMD playback) is still in testing: prototype workflows validated on two reference models so far; K-frame baking and toe/heel roll controls are pending.
- VMD light and self-shadow frames are not imported or exported.
- PMX Bone, UV, Material, Flip and Impulse Morph data do not all map to active Blender effects yet.
- PMX export currently accepts models imported by SekaiBlender with source-retention data; arbitrary native Blender meshes are rejected rather than exported with guessed semantics.
- Realtime physics sessions are independent per model within one Scene. Different Scenes cannot own simultaneous global realtime schedulers.

## Project Status

This GitHub `main` branch is an intentionally history-trimmed source snapshot. It contains the complete current source tree and SekaiBlender modifications, while the upstream Blender commit history is kept out of this public snapshot to keep the repository practical to clone and maintain.

## Contributing

Bug reports and focused pull requests are welcome. For changes to PMX, VMD, IK or physics, include the smallest reproducible asset or test case available and describe the expected Blender-side result.

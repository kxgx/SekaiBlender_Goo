 * Export one Camera Object's Action as the camera section of a VMD file.

 * Two source layouts are supported, both evaluated from F-Curves rather than the depsgraph:
 *
 * - Camera rig: the Camera is parented to the Empty produced by `create_vmd_camera_rig()`. The
 *   Empty carries the MMD look-at center and rotation, the Camera's local Y carries distance, and
 *   the Camera data carries view angle and projection. This is the exact inverse of the importer,
 *   so VMD Bezier control bytes round-trip.
 * - Standalone Camera: an unparented Camera authored in Blender. Its world pose is written with
 *   distance zero, which MMD replays identically. Rotation cannot keep per-channel Bezier data
 *   because the MMD rotation is a non-linear recomposition of the Camera's own Euler channels, so
 *   rotation degrades to linear.
 *
 * A Camera parented to anything other than a conforming Empty is rejected instead of guessed.
